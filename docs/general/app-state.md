# App State Management via Redux

If you haven't worked with Redux, it's highly recommended (possibly indispensable!)
to read through the (amazing) [official documentation](http://redux.js.org)
and/or watch this [free video tutorial series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux).

## Usage

See above! As minimal as Redux is, the challenge it addresses - app state
management - is a complex topic that is too involved to properly discuss here.
